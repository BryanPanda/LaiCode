// Randomly generate a maze of size N * N (where N = 2K + 1) whose corridor
// and wallâ€™s width are both 1 cell. 
// For each pair of cells on the corridor, there must exist one and only one
// path between them. (Randomly means that the solution is generated randomly, 
// and whenever the program is executed, the solution can be different.). 
// The wall is denoted by 1 in the matrix and corridor is denoted by 0.

// Assumptions:
// 1. N = 2K + 1 and K >= 0
// 2. the top left corner must be corridor
// 3. there should be as many corridor cells as possible
// 4. for each pair of cells on the corridor, there must exist one and only one path between them
